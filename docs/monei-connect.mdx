Become an integrated payments partner to quickly and easily provide payment services to your platform or marketplace users with [MONEI Connect](https://monei.com/connect/).

## Before you begin

ðŸ“Œ Please contact [connect@monei.com](mailto:connect@monei.com) to register as a partner. The following information is required:

- IPs of your servers so we can add them to our whitelist
- Email address that we can send the partner API Key to
- Email address or URL for partner account notifications (choose 1): With the MONEI Connect integration youâ€™ll receive notifications via email or webhook when your users/merchants register for a MONEI account via your linked partner account. When your users/merchants register, youâ€™ll receive the company details and the associated account ID. Youâ€™ll receive notifications when the account is pending approval and when it is approved or rejected

**The following data must be provided for all users that require access to your partner account:**

- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone number


:::note
In the same email to [connect@monei.com](mailto:connect@monei.com) please let us know whether you want the daily fee to be charged by MONEI to your users/merchants or to your master partner account. MONEI daily fees are:


- MONEI Pay 0,03 â‚¬/day
- MONEI X 0,1 â‚¬/day
- MONEI PLUS 39,99 â‚¬/day
:::

**Once youâ€™ve completed registration for your partner account, youâ€™ll receive:**

- Partner API Key that lets you access our APIs on behalf of each MONEI account bound to your partner account.
- Unique registration link that lets your users/merchants register their MONEI account. Every user that registers with this link will be bound to your partner account.
- Access to the Partner Dashboard, where you can see payments, aggregated analytics, and details about each MONEI account bound to your partner account.

## Integration

To access the MONEI APIs, you need to provide your Partner API Key in the `Authorization` header of each request as well as `MONEI-Account-ID` header with the ID of the MONEI Account to indicate which account you are acting on behalf of.
