You can integrate with MONEI as a partner to provide payment services to your clients using MONEI Connect.

## Before you begin

Please contact connect@monei.com to get registered as a partner. The necessary data that must be sent to register are:

- IPs of your servers to be able to add them to our whitelist.
- Contact email to send the API Key partner
- The connect integration allows you to receive notifications via email or webhook of new accounts that are registered with MONEI linked to your partner account. Only one option can be used. The information that will be shared will be the company details and also the associated accountId. These notifications will be received when the account is pending approval, approval or rejection. It is for this reason that we need an email or a url where to send said information.

Finally, the following data must be sent for all users who must have access to your partner account:

- Name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone number

When you are registered, you will receive:

- Partner API Key that allows to access our APIs on behalf of each MONEI Account bound to your Partner account.
- Unique registration link that allows your clients to register their MONEI Account. Every client registered using this link will be bound to your Partner account.
- Access to the Partner Dashboard, where you can see payments, aggregated analytics as well as details about each MONEI Account bound to your Partner account.

In the same email to connect@monei.com please inform us whether you want the daily fee to be charged by MONEI to your merchants/clients or to your Master account. MONEI daily fees are: MONEI Pay 0,03 €/day - MONEI X 0,1 €/day, - MONEI PLUS  39,99 €/day.

## Integration

To access the MONEI APIs, you need to provide your Partner API Key in the `Authorization` header of each request as well as `MONEI-Account-ID` header with the ID of the MONEI Account to indicate which account you are acting on behalf of.
