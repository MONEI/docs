Accept [Bizum](https://bizum.es/) payments to provide your customers with a secure and convenient way to make instant payments from their smartphones, desktops, or tablets. Bizum, a trusted Spanish mobile payment solution, ensures seamless transactions across multiple devices.

Easily start accepting Bizum payments on your website or mobile app with the [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [Bizum Component](monei-js/reference.md#bizu-component). No extra configuration is needed to enable Bizum on the Hosted Payment Page.

The [Bizum Component](monei-js/reference.md#bizum-component) adds a dedicated Bizum button to your payment page. When customers select Bizum, an overlay appears, allowing them to enter their registered phone number to complete the payment quickly and securely.

Online Bizum transactions do not have a maximum amount limit. However, if a transaction fails, it may be due to the issuing bank imposing its own limit or insufficient funds in the consumer's account. Unlike the peer-to-peer (P2P) limits imposed by Bizum, there is no monthly cap on the number of online purchases a customer can make using the service.

With Bizum, you can perform pre-authentications and capture payments at a later time. During pre-authentication, the Bizum number is verified to confirm it belongs to the account holder via an online API, without holding or authorizing any funds as done in card pre-authorizations. Once the account holder is authenticated successfully, you have up to 30 days to capture the payment for the specified amount. If insufficient funds are available in the linked IBAN at the time of capture, the transaction will not proceed. No additional Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) or challenge is required from the Bizum holder during the capture. Note that Bizum payment authentications are available only if the customer's bank supports the RTP (Request to Pay) flow.

Bizum transactions can be refunded within 365 days after the initial transaction has been processed.

:::caution Bizum Payment Status Monitoring
The status of a payment is a critical aspect of a transaction, as any discrepancy between the payment gateway and the processor can have serious consequences for both the merchant and the consumer. An error in this area can result in failed transactions, financial losses, or trust issues between the involved parties. For this reason, MONEI has developed an exclusive internal technology that ensures the security of the status of each transaction made through the Bizum payment method at all times. This advanced technology allows MONEI to monitor and verify each transaction with precision, ensuring that payments are processed efficiently and without errors, thus providing greater peace of mind for both merchants and consumers.This functionality is exclusively available worldwide through the MONEI Bizum API, with no other tech companies having access to it.

:::note
You can [send a payment request](/api/#operation/payments_send_request) directly to the customer’s phone. If the Bizum payment method is available and the phone number is registered with Bizum, the customer will receive a push notification to confirm the payment directly in their banking app. If not, they’ll receive a payment link via WhatsApp. This feature works independently of the UI Component.

Example of a Bizum push notification:

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add Bizum to your payment page. To accept Bizum payments please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new) to configure Bizum.

Before you start, you need to make sure that you have Bizum enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Use the test [phone numbers](testing.md#test-bizum-phone-numbers).
- You can check the status of a test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Add Bizum to your payment page `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v2/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [Bizun Component](monei-js/reference.md#bizum-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM node (container) with unique ID in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<form
  action="https://secure.monei.com/payments/{{payment_id}}/confirm"
  method="post"
  id="payment-form"
>
  <div id="bizum_container">
    <!-- A MONEI Bizum Component will be inserted here. -->
  </div>
</form>
```

Initialize Bizum Component

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the Bizum component.
const bizum = monei.Bizum({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onSubmit(result) {
    moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});

// Render an instance of the Bizum component into the `bizum_container` <div>.
bizum.render('#bizum_container');
```

:::note
Bizum Component is also available as a React and Vue component. [Check out our examples](monei-js/overview.mdx#card-input-component).
:::

Check the [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js/reference.md#bizum-component) for more options.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#confirmpayment-function) function

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with PayPal Component. You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/api/#operation/payments_confirm).

```js title="client.js"
// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}', paymentToken: token})
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

:::note
As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/api/#operation/payments_confirm) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about the payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have connected your Bizum business account in [MONEI Dashboard](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).
