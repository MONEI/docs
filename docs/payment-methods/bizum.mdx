description: Learn how to accept Bizum payments with MONEI.
---

[Bizum](https://bizum.es/) is a Spanish instant mobile payment solution. Accept Bizum payments to let your customers make secure payments from the convenience of their smartphones.

You can start accepting Bizum payments on the Web using [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [Bizum Component](monei-js/reference.md#bizu-component). No additional configuration is required to use Bizum in Hosted Payment Page.

Our [Bizum Component](monei-js/reference.md#bizum-component) renders Bizum button to your payment page.
When a customer selects Bizum, the component presents a Bizum overlay, where a customer can enter his phone number registered in Bizum to complete the payment process.

import {Bizum} from '../../src/components/Bizum';

<div className="preview-frame">
  <div className="payment-button">
    <Bizum />
  </div>
</div>

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add Bizum to your payment page. To accept Bizum payments please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new) to configure Bizum.

Before you start, you need to make sure that you have Bizum enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).

Unfortunately Bizum does not provide test environment

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Add Bizum to your payment page `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v1/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [Bizun Component](monei-js/reference.md#bizum-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM node (container) with unique ID in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<form
  action="https://secure.monei.com/payments/{{payment_id}}/confirm"
  method="post"
  id="payment-form"
>
  <div id="bizum_container">
    <!-- A MONEI Bizum Component will be inserted here. -->
  </div>
</form>
```

Initialize Bizum Component

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the Bizum component.
var bizum = monei.Bizum({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onSubmit(result) {
    moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});

// Render an instance of the Bizum component into the `bizum_container` <div>.
bizum.render('#bizum_container');
```

:::note
Bizum Component is also available as React and Vue component. [Check out our examples](monei-js/overview.mdx#card-input-component).
:::

Check [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js/reference.md#bizum-component) for more options.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to submit the form

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with Bizum Component. You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/api/#operation/payments_confirm).

```js title="client.js"
// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  var paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');
  // Insert the token ID into the form so it gets submitted to the server
  var hiddenInput = document.createElement('input');
  hiddenInput.setAttribute('type', 'hidden');
  hiddenInput.setAttribute('name', 'paymentToken');
  hiddenInput.setAttribute('value', token);
  paymentForm.appendChild(hiddenInput);

  // Submit the form
  paymentForm.submit();
}
```

Your customer will be redirected to the Bizum confirmation screen

:::note
Currently Bizum only supports redirect flow. **It is not possible to confirm payments using monei.js** [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#moneiconfirmpayment-function) function. As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/api/#operation/payments_confirm) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about a payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have connected your Bizum business account in [MONEI Dashboard](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).
