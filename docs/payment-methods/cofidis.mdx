You can start accepting [Cofidis](https://www.cofidis.es/) installment payments on the Web using [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [Cofidis Component](monei-js/reference.md#cofidis-component). No additional configuration is required to use Cofidis 4xcard in Hosted Payment Page.

Our [Cofidis Component](monei-js/reference.md#cofidis-component) renders Cofidis button to your payment page.
When a customer selects "Pay with Cofidis", the component presents a Cofidis overlay, where the customer could see commercial conditions, legal information and continue to the Cofidis payment page .

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';

<div className="preview-frame">
  <div className="payment-button" style={{height: 115}}>
    <BrowserOnly>
      {() => {
        const Cofidis = require('../../src/components/Cofidis').default;
        return <Cofidis />;
      }}
    </BrowserOnly>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

We also provide a [Cofidis Widget](monei-js/reference.md#cofidiswidget-component) that dynamically calculates the conditions for a loan based on the given price.

<div className="preview-frame">
  <div className="payment-button">
    <div style={{maxWidth: 500}}>
      <BrowserOnly>
        {() => {
          const CofidisWidget = require('../../src/components/CofidisWidget').default;
          return <CofidisWidget />;
        }}
      </BrowserOnly>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br />

Check our guide [how to add it to your cart or product page](guides/setup-cofidis-widget.mdx).

:::caution
If you are using Cofidis payment method it is mandatory to put [view details](https://monei.com/cofidis/) link or Cofidis Widget to your cart or product page.

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add Cofidis to your custom payment page. If you don't need a custom checkout experience we recommend using our [prebuilt payment page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx). It already supports all available payment methods and does not require coding.

Before you start, you need to make sure that you have Cofidis enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).

Unfortunately Cofidis does not provide test environment

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/apis/rest/schemas/payment/) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \

   },
  "completeUrl": "https://example.com/receipt",
  "cancelUrl": "https://example.com/checkout",

}'

```

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',

  },
  completeUrl: 'https://example.com/receipt',
  cancelUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout',
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',

  ],
  'completeUrl' => 'https://example.com/receipt',
  'cancelUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout',
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.
- **completeUrl** `string` - A customer will be redirected to this url when the payment is complete (successful or failed).
- **cancelUrl** `string` - A customer is redirected to this url if he cancels the payment (clicks "Go back")

Check all available [request parameters](/apis/rest/payments-create/).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Add Cofidis to your payment page `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v2/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [Cofidis Component](monei-js/reference.md#cofidis-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM node (container) with unique ID in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<div id="cofidis_container">
  <!-- A MONEI Cofidis Component will be inserted here. -->
</div>
```

Initialize Cofidis Component

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the Cofidis component.
const cofidis = monei.Cofidis({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onSubmit(result) {
    // Redirect the customer to the Cofidis payment page
    window.location.assign(result.redirectUrl);
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});

// Render an instance of the cofidis component into the `cofidis_container` <div>.
cofidis.render('#cofidis_container');
```

:::note
Cofidis Component is also available as a React and Vue component. [Check out our examples](monei-js/overview.mdx#card-input-component).
:::

Check the [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js/reference.md#Cofidis-component) for more options.

### 3. Check the payment status `Server-side`

After the payment is completed the customer is redirected to the `completeUrl` with **payment_id** query parameter, you can obtain the status of the payment by calling [get payment](/apis/rest/payments-get/) endpoint.

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about the payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/apis/rest/schemas/payment/) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have connected your Cofidis business account in [MONEI Dashboard](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).
