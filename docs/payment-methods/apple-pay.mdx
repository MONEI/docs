description: Learn how to accept Apple Pay payments with MONEI.
---

You can start accepting Apple Pay payments on the Web using [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [Payment Request Component](monei-js/payment-request.mdx). No additional configuration is required to use Apple Pay in Hosted Payment Page.

Our [Payment Request Component](monei-js/payment-request.mdx) gives you a single integration for Apple Pay and Google Pay. Customers see a Google Pay or an Apple Pay button, depending on what their device and browser combination supports.

:::info
Open this page in Safari to see the Apple Pay button.

If you prefer to integrate directly against the Apple Pay API, follow our [Apple Pay direct API integration guide](#apple-pay-direct-api-integration).

## Apple Pay direct API integration

Before you start, you need to:

- Add a card to your Wallet for Safari.
- Serve your application over HTTPS. This is a requirement both in development and in production. One way to get up and running is to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
- [Register your domain with Apple Pay](monei-js/payment-request.mdx#register-your-domain-with-apple-pay), both in development and production.
- Follow [Applesâ€™s instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web).

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v2/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create Apple Pay Session

```javascript
const session = new window.ApplePaySession(3, request);
session.onvalidatemerchant = async (event: any) => {
  try {
    const merchantSession = await monei.api.createApplePaySession({
      accountId: 'MONEI_ACCOUNT_ID',
      displayName: 'Test Merchant',
      domainName: 'example.com',
      validationUrl: event.validationURL
    });
    session.completeMerchantValidation(merchantSession);
  } catch (error) {
    session.abort();
  }
};
```

Exchange Apple Pay token for MONEI Payment Token that can be used to confirm payment as described in [step 3](#3-confirm-the-payment-client-side).

```javascript
session.onpaymentauthorized = async (event) => {
  // Encode Apple Pay token as a base64 string
  const paymentToken = JSON.stringify(event.payment.token);
  const token = window.btoa(paymentToken);
  try {
    const result = await monei.api.createToken({
      paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
      paymentMethod: {
        applePay: {token}
      }
    });
    session.completePayment({
      status: window.ApplePaySession.STATUS_SUCCESS
    });
    return moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
  } catch (error) {
    session.completePayment({
      status: window.ApplePaySession.STATUS_FAILURE
    });
  }
};
session.begin();
```

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have at least one [enabled card processor](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card).
- Contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new) to configure Apple Pay in production.
