Our [Google Pay Component](monei-js-api.md#moneigooglepay-component) renders Google Pay button in your payment form. When a customer selects Google Pay, the Component presents the Google Pay payment sheet where a customer can choose a card he wants to use. If a customer selects a card that requires 3D Secure confirmation the payment confirmation step will automatically show a 3D Secure confirmation popup.

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"

   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Collect card details `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v1/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [Google Pay Component](monei-js-api.md#moneigooglepay-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM node (container) with unique ID in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<div id="gpay_container">
  <!-- A MONEI Google Pay Component will be inserted here. -->
</div>
```

Initialize MONEI Google Pay

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the Google Pay component.
var googlePay = monei.GooglePay({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onSubmit(result) {
    moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});

// Render an instance of the GooglePay component into the `gpay_container` <div>.
googlePay.render('#gpay_container');
```

Check [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js-api.md#moneigooglepay-component) for more options.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js-api.md#moneiconfirmpayment-function) function

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with Google Pay Component. You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/api/#operation/payments_confirm).

```js title="client.js"
// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}', paymentToken: token})
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

After the payment is submitted MONEI will automatically show a popup window with 3D Secure confirmation screen (if needed)

:::note
As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/api/#operation/payments_confirm) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about a payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.
