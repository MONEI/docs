You can start accepting Google Pay payments on the Web using [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [Payment Request Component](monei-js/payment-request.mdx). No additional configuration is required.

Our [Payment Request Component](monei-js/payment-request.mdx) gives you a single integration for Apple Pay and Google Pay. Customers see a Google Pay or an Apple Pay button, depending on what their device and browser combination supports.

If you prefer to integrate directly against the Google Pay API, follow our [Google Pay direct API integration guide](#google-pay-direct-api-integration).

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add Google Pay to your payment page. To accept Google Pay payments you need to have at least one configured card processor.

To configure card processors go to [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods → Card payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card).

Before you start, you need to:

- Make sure that you have Google Pay enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).
- Add a card in Chrome.
- Serve your application over HTTPS. This is a requirement both in development and in production. One way to get up and running is to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- You can use any real card details, you will not be charged in the test mode (card details are automatically replaced with the test card).
- You can check the status of the test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

:::note Google Pay Terms
By integrating Google Pay™, you adhere to the Google Pay APIs [Acceptable Use Policy](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/aup) and accept the terms defined in the Google Pay API [Terms of Service](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos).

## Google Pay direct API integration

If you prefer to integrate directly against the Google Pay API, follow [Google's instructions](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/setup).

Specify following tokenization specification

```javascript
const tokenizationSpecification = {
  type: 'PAYMENT_GATEWAY',
  parameters: {
    gateway: 'monei',
    gatewayMerchantId: 'MONEI_ACCOUNT_ID'
  }
};
```

To use Google Pay API directly you need to [request production access](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/request-prod-access) and obtain your `merchantId` in Google Console (this step is not required if you are using our Google Pay Сomponent).

```javascript
paymentDataRequest.merchantInfo = {
  merchantName: 'Example Merchant',
  merchantId: 'GOOGLE_MERCHANT_ID'
};
```

Exchange Google Pay token for MONEI Payment Token that can be used to confirm payment as described in [step 3](#3-confirm-the-payment-client-side).

```javascript
function processPayment(paymentData) {
  // Encode Google Pay token as a base64 string
  const token = window.btoa(paymentData.paymentMethodData.tokenizationData.token);
  return monei.api
    .createToken({
      paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
      paymentMethod: {
        googlePay: {
          token: token
        }
      }
    })
    .then(function (result) {
      return moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
    });
}
```

## 3. Confirm the payment client-side

After you have obtained the MONEI Payment Token, you can confirm the payment using the token.

```javascript
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}', paymentToken: token})
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have at least one [enabled card processor](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card).
- Make sure that you have Google Pay enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).
