description: Learn how to accept PayPal payments with MONEI.
---

You can start accepting PayPal payments on the Web using [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [PayPal Component](monei-js/reference.md#paypal-component). No additional configuration is required to use PayPal in Hosted Payment Page.

Our [PayPal Component](monei-js/reference.md#paypal-component) renders PayPal button to your payment page.
When a customer selects PayPal, the component presents a PayPal overlay, where a customer can log in with their PayPal account details to complete the payment process.

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add PayPal to your custom payment page. If you don't need a custom checkout experience we recommend using our [prebuilt payment page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx). It already supports all available payment methods and does not require coding.

To accept PayPal payments you need to connect your [PayPal business account](https://www.paypal.com/business).
To connect your PayPal business account go to [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Connect test [PayPal Business account](testing.md#test-paypal-accounts) in your [MONEI Dashboard](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods) (in test mode)
- Use the test [PayPal Personal account](testing.md#test-paypal-accounts) for payments.
- You can check the status of a test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/docs/apis/rest/schemas/payment/) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \

  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/docs/apis/rest/payments-create/).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Add PayPal to your payment page `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v2/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [PayPal Component](monei-js/reference.md#paypal-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM node (container) with unique ID in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<div id="paypal_container">
  <!-- A MONEI PayPal Component will be inserted here. -->
</div>
```

Initialize PayPal Component

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the PayPal component.
const payPal = monei.PayPal({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onSubmit(result) {
    moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});

// Render an instance of the PayPal component into the `paypal_container` <div>.
payPal.render('#paypal_container');
```

:::note
PayPal Component is also available as a React and Vue component. [Check out our examples](monei-js/overview.mdx#card-input-component).
:::

Check the [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js/reference.md#paypal-component) for more options.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#confirmpayment-function) function

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with PayPal Component. You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/docs/apis/rest/payments-confirm/).

```js title="client.js"
// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}', paymentToken: token})
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

:::note
As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/docs/apis/rest/payments-confirm/) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about the payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/docs/apis/rest/schemas/payment/) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have connected your PayPal business account in [MONEI Dashboard](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods).
