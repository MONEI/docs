description: Learn how to accept Card payments with MONEI.
---

You can start accepting Card payments on the Web using [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx) or [Card Input Component](monei-js/reference.md#cardinput-component). No additional configuration is required for the Hosted Payment Page. It already supports all available payment methods and does not require coding.

Our [Card Input Component](monei-js/reference.md#cardinput-component) renders a card input to your custom payment page. The Card Input Component lets you securely collect card information all within one component. It includes a dynamically-updating card brand icon as well as inputs for number, expiry and CVC. It is responsive, optimized for mobile devices, completely customizable and localized to 14 languages.

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add Card Input Component to your custom payment page. If you don't need a custom checkout experience we recommend using our [Hosted Payment Page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx).

To accept card payments you need to have at least one configured Card processor.
To configure Card processors go to [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods → Card payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card).

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Use the test [card numbers](testing.md#test-card-numbers).
- You can check the status of a test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Collect card details `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v2/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [Card Input Component](monei-js/reference.md#cardinput-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM nodes (containers) with unique IDs in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<form id="payment-form">
  <div class="card-field">
    <div id="card-input">
      <!-- A MONEI Card Input Component will be inserted here. -->
    </div>
    <!-- Used to display card errors. -->
    <div id="card-error"></div>
  </div>
  <button type="submit" id="payment-button">Submit payment</button>
</form>
```

Initialize Card Input Component

```js title="client.js"
const container = document.getElementById('card-input');
const errorText = document.getElementById('card-error');

// Create an instance of the Card Input using payment_id.
const cardInput = monei.CardInput({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onChange: function (event) {
    // Handle real-time validation errors.
    if (event.isTouched && event.error) {
      container.classList.add('is-invalid');
      errorText.innerText = event.error;
    } else {
      container.classList.remove('is-invalid');
      errorText.innerText = '';
    }
  }
});

// Render an instance of the Card Input into the `card_input` <div>.
cardInput.render(container);
```

The Card Input Component simplifies the form and minimizes the number of required fields by inserting a single, flexible input field that securely collects all necessary card details.

:::note
Card Input Component is also available as a React and Vue component. [Check out our examples](monei-js/overview.mdx#card-input-component).
:::

Check the [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js/reference.md#cardinput-component) for more options.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#moneiconfirmpayment-function) function

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with Card Input Component. You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/api/#operation/payments_confirm).

```js title="client.js"
// Handle form submission.
const paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');
const paymentButton = document.getElementById('payment-button');
paymentForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  paymentButton.disabled = true;
  monei
    .createToken(cardInput)
    .then(function (result) {
      console.log(result);
      if (result.error) {
        // Inform the user if there was an error.
        container.classList.add('is-invalid');
        errorText.innerText = result.error;
      } else {
        // Send the token to MONEI.
        moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
      }
      paymentButton.disabled = false;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      paymentButton.disabled = false;
      console.log(error);
    });
});

// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({
      paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
      paymentToken: token,
      paymentMethod: {card: {cardholderName: 'JOHN DOE'}}
    })
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

After the form is submitted MONEI will automatically show a popup window with 3d secure confirmation screen (if needed)

:::note
As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/api/#operation/payments_confirm) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about the payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have at least one [enabled card processor](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card).
