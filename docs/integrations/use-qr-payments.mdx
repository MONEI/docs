Login into [pay.monei.com](https://pay.monei.com/) with your same credentials you use to access [dashboard.monei.com](https://dashboard.monei.com/) and start creating payments

:::note
The payment is accessible through the QR code during **5 minutes**, after that you need to create a new payment.

## Demo

import {ArrowRightIcon} from '@heroicons/react/outline';

<div className="flex-container">
  <img src="/img/qr.png" alt="QR" width="300" height="300" />
  <ArrowRightIcon style={{width: 50, margin: '0 50px', color: 'var(--docsearch-muted-color)'}} />
  <img src="/img/qr-demo.png" alt="QR demo" width="300" />
</div>

## Create QR payments programmatically

Each QR code is associated with a Point of Sale. To create a payment associated with a specific QR code you need to pass `pointOfSaleId`.
To get your `pointOfSaleId` please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new).

### 1. Create a new payment on your server.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script {8} title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "amount": 110,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "orderId": "14379133960355",
    "pointOfSaleId": 'fb269cccfa0cc021f5d0b8eb1421646c696213e1',
    "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js {7} title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  pointOfSaleId: 'fb269cccfa0cc021f5d0b8eb1421646c696213e1',
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

```php {6} title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'pointOfSaleId' => 'fb269cccfa0cc021f5d0b8eb1421646c696213e1',
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **pointOfSaleId** `string` - A unique identifier of the Point of Sale.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

After the payment is created it is immediately available through the QR code attached to the Point of Sale.

:::note
As an alternative you can present to the user a unique QR code generated for this specifc payment. To access the QR code image construct the following url `https://secure.monei.com/payments/{{payment_id}}/qr`

You can directly render it on to your webpage using this html code:

```html
<img src="https://secure.monei.com/payments/{{payment_id}}/qr" width="300" height="300" />
```

### 2. Customer completes the payment

Customer completes the payment on the hosted payment page and is redirected to the receipt page where he can optionally enter his email to receive the receipt.

### 3. An asynchronous request is sent to your server

MONEI will notify you about the payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain the full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when the customer closed the browser window or lost Internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that the received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge the receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.
