MONEI Payment Modal is the simplest way to securely collect payments from your customers without them leaving your website.

Collecting payments on your website consists of creating a payment object, and confirming the payment.

Apple Pay and Bizum are not available when using MONEI Payment Modal integration.

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#confirmpayment-function) function

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v2/monei.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <form id="payment-form" action="https://secure.monei.com/payments/{{payment_id}}" method="GET">
    <button id="payment-button" type="submit">Pay</button>
  </form>
</body>
```

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)). You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/monei-js/reference.md#confirmpayment-function).

```js title="client.js"
// Handle form submission.
const paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');
const paymentButton = document.getElementById('payment-button');
paymentForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  paymentButton.disabled = true;
  monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}'})
    .then(function (result) {
      paymentButton.disabled = false;
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
      if (result.status === 'SUCCEEDED') {
        handleResult(result);
      } else {
        handleError(result);
      }
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      paymentButton.disabled = false;
      console.log(error);
    });
});
```

After the form is submitted MONEI will automatically show a popup window with a payment page to collect payment details and then a 3d secure confirmation screen (if needed)

:::note
As an alternative process you can redirect your customer to `payment.nextAction.redirectUrl` on the server-side. Check our [prebuilt payment page guide](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx)
:::

### 3. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about the payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.
