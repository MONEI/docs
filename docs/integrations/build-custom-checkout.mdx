**MONEI Components:**

- Generate a one time `paymentToken` that can be used to securely process a payment.
- Are available in plain JavaScript, React, Vue and Angular.
- Support different styles, languages and customizations.
- do not require PCI compliance.

Check the detailed guides for each payment method in our [Payment Methods](/payment-methods/card.mdx) section.

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add different payment methods to your custom payment page. If you don't need a custom checkout experience we recommend using our [prebuilt payment page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx). It already supports all available payment methods and does not require coding.

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure you have all payment methods configured. Check the [Payment Methods](/payment-methods/card.mdx) section for more details about each payment method.
- You can check the status of a test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard â†’ Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

## Integration

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client-side. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Add Component to your payment page `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v1/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create empty DOM nodes (containers) with unique IDs in your checkout page.

```html title="checkout.html"
<div id="container">
  <!-- A MONEI Card Input Component will be inserted here. -->
</div>
```

Initialize Component

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the Card Input using payment_id.
var cardInput = monei.CardInput({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  ...otherOptions
});

// Render an instance of the Card Input into the `container` <div>.
cardInput.render('#container');
```

If you have a checkout flow that requires you to generate a payment token before you create a payment on your server, you can initialize MONEI Components by providing the following parameters:

- **accountId** `string` - Your MONEI account ID. Instead of passing **paymentId** you can initialize a card input with the **accountId** and **sessionId** (optional). Generate a payment token before you create the payment itself.
- **sessionId** `string` - Unique session ID in your system. Provide a different **sessionId** for each customer. Use this parameter to ensure that the customer who generated the token is the same as the one doing the payment. Only required if you pass a token to your server. If you provide a **sessionId** when initializing MONEI component you will need to provide the same value when you [create a payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server.
- **amount** `positive integer` (not required for CardInput) - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD). You'll need to pass the same value when creating the payment.
- **currency** `string` (not required for CardInput) - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency. You'll need to pass the same value when creating the payment.

Check the [Payment Methods](/payment-methods/card.mdx) section for more details about how to initialize components for each payment method.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#moneiconfirmpayment-function) function

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with Component. Check the [Payment Methods](/payment-methods/card.mdx) section for more details about how to generate `paymentToken` for each payment method.

You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/api/#operation/payments_confirm).

```js title="client.js"
monei
  .createToken(cardInput)
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result);
    if (result.error) {
      // Inform the user if there was an error.
    } else {
      // Send the token to MONEI.
      moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
    }
    paymentButton.disabled = false;
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    paymentButton.disabled = false;
    console.log(error);
  });

// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}', paymentToken: token})
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

After you confirm the payment, MONEI will automatically show a popup window with a 3d secure confirmation screen (if needed, depending on the payment method).

:::note
As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/api/#operation/payments_confirm) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about a payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when a customer closes the browser window or loses internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that the received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure you have a [payment method configured and enabled](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods) in live mode.
