MONEI [Payment Request Component](monei-js/reference.md#moneigooglepay-component) gives you a single integration for Apple Pay and Google Pay. Customers see a Google Pay or an Apple Pay button, depending on what their device and browser combination supports.

:::note
Apple Pay with the Payment Request Component requires macOS 10.12.1+ or iOS 10.1+.
:::

## Before you begin

This page explains how to add Payment Request Component to your payment page. To accept Apple Pay and Google Pay payments you need to have at least one configured credit card processor.

To configure credit card processors go to [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods → Credit card payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card).

Before you start, you need to:

- Add a payment method to your browser. For example, you can save a card in Chrome, or add a card to your Wallet for Safari.
- Serve your application over HTTPS. This is a requirement both in development and in production. One way to get up and running is to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
- [Verify your domain with Apple Pay](#verify-your-domain-with-apple-pay), both in development and production.

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- You can use any real credit card details, you will not be charged in the test mode (credit card details are automatically replaced with the test card).
- You can check the status of the test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

## Verify your domain with Apple Pay

- Download this [domain association file](https://assets.monei.com/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association/) and host it at `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` on your site.

  For example, if you’re registering https://example.com, make that file available at https://example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.

- Next, contact [MONEI Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new) register your domain with Apple.

## Integration

### 1. Create a Payment `Server-side`

Create a [Payment](/api/#section/Payment-object) on your server with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
   },
  "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback"
}'

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback'
]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

Included in the returned Payment object is a payment `id`, which is used on the client side to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire Payment object.

### 2. Add Payment Request Component to your payment page `Client-side`

Include `monei.js` on your checkout page by adding the script tag to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html title="checkout.html"
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.monei.com/v1/monei.js"></script>
</head>
```

Add MONEI [Payment Request Component](monei-js/reference.md#paymentrequest-ui-component) to your payment page. Create empty DOM node (container) with unique ID in your payment form.

```html title="checkout.html"
<div id="payment_request_container">
  <!-- Payment Request Component will be inserted here. -->
</div>
```

Initialize Payment Request Component

```js title="client.js"
// Create an instance of the Google Pay component.
var paymentRequest = monei.PaymentRequest({
  paymentId: '{{payment_id}}',
  onSubmit(result) {
    moneiTokenHandler(result.token);
  },
  onError(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});

// Render an instance of the Payment Request Component into the `payment_request_container` <div>.
paymentRequest.render('#payment_request_container');
```

Check [MONEI JS Reference](monei-js/reference.md#paymentrequest-ui-component) for more options.

### 3. Confirm the payment `Client-side`

To complete the payment you need to confirm it using monei.js [confirmPayment](monei-js/reference.md#moneiconfirmpayment-function) function

You need to provide a `paymentId` (obtained in [step 1](#1-create-a-payment-server-side)) and `paymentToken` generated with Payment Request Component. You can also provide additional parameters like `customer.email`. Check all available [parameters](/api/#operation/payments_confirm).

```js title="client.js"
// Confirm the payment
function moneiTokenHandler(token) {
  return monei
    .confirmPayment({paymentId: '{{payment_id}}', paymentToken: token})
    .then(function (result) {
      // At this moment you can show a customer the payment result
      // But you should always rely on the result passed to the callback endpoint on your server
      // to update the order status
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

:::note
As an alternative process you can submit generated `paymentToken` to your sever and then [confirm payment](/api/#operation/payments_confirm) on the server-side.
:::

### 4. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about a payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](guides/verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Make sure that you have at least one [enabled credit card processor](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods/card)
- Contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new) to configure Google Pay in production.
