The Apple Pay Domain API allows you to register and manage domains for Apple Pay integration.

With the Apple Pay Domain API, you can:

- Register domains to use with Apple Pay
- View currently registered domains
- Ensure your website is properly configured for Apple Pay payments

Apple requires domain verification before you can accept Apple Pay payments on your website.
This API simplifies the process of registering your domains with Apple Pay and maintaining
your domain verification status.

## Domain registration process

To accept Apple Pay on your website, you must register your domain with Apple. This process:

1. Verifies that you control the domain
2. Allows Apple Pay buttons to be displayed on your website
3. Enables secure payment processing through Apple Pay

Once registered, your domain will be authorized to display Apple Pay payment options to customers.
