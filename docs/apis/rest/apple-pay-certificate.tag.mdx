Manage Apple Pay certificates for iOS app integration.

To accept Apple Pay in your iOS app, you need an Apple Pay Payment Processing Certificate.
This API provides a complete certificate management workflow:

1. **Create** - Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
2. **Upload to Apple** - Use the CSR to create a certificate in Apple Developer Portal
3. **Activate** - Upload the signed certificate from Apple to enable payment processing
4. **Manage** - Enable, disable, or delete certificates as needed

The private key is securely generated and stored by MONEI. You never need to handle private keys directly.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
