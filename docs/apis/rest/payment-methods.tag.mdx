The Payment Methods API allows you to retrieve available payment methods for an account or a specific payment.
This information can be used to display appropriate payment options to your customers.

Payment methods vary by country, currency, and merchant configuration. This API helps you dynamically
determine which payment methods are available for a specific transaction or account.

You can use this API to:

- Get all payment methods available for an account
- Get payment methods available for a specific payment
- Display payment options to your customers based on their location and purchase details
