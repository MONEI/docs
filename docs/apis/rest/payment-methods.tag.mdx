<p>
  The Payment Methods API allows you to retrieve available payment methods for an account or a
  specific payment. This information can be used to display appropriate payment options to your
  customers.
</p>
<p>
  Payment methods vary by country, currency, and merchant configuration. This API helps you
  dynamically determine which payment methods are available for a specific transaction or account.
</p>
<p>You can use this API to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get all payment methods available for an account</li>
  <li>Get payment methods available for a specific payment</li>
  <li>Display payment options to your customers based on their location and purchase details</li>
</ul>
