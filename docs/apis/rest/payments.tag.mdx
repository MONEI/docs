The Payments API provides a comprehensive platform for processing transactions and managing the complete payment lifecycle.

### Core Payment Operations

- Create and process payments with multiple payment methods
- Authorize payments and capture funds later
- Cancel authorized payments to release reserved funds
- Refund payments partially or in full
- Generate detailed receipts for completed payments

### Customer Experience Features

- Send payment requests via WhatsApp, SMS, or Bizum
- Create and distribute payment links through various channels
- Generate permanent payment tokens for one-click checkout experiences
- Support recurring billing and subscription payments

### Implementation Best Practices

- Create one payment per order or customer session for clear transaction records
- Use the unique payment ID for all subsequent operations on a payment
- Generate permanent payment tokens (with `generatePaymentToken: true`) for returning customers
- Implement webhook notifications to receive real-time payment status updates

## Payment Status Codes

The MONEI API returns a `statusCode` attribute in the Payment response to indicate the outcome of your request. This helps you understand whether an operation was successful or why it failed.

### Success Codes

Successful transactions return the following codes:

| Code | Message                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| E000 | Transaction approved               |
| E001 | Transaction pending processing     |
| E002 | Transaction pending authentication |
| E003 | Transaction pending authorization  |
