The Subscriptions API provides a powerful solution for managing recurring billing and subscription-based business models.

## Key Features

### Flexible Billing Options

- **Multiple billing intervals**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly billing cycles
- **Custom intervals**: Configure non-standard periods using intervalCount (e.g., every 3 months)
- **Trial periods**: Offer free trials before the first billing cycle begins
- **Variable amounts**: Update subscription amounts for pricing changes or upgrades

### Complete Lifecycle Management

- **Create subscriptions**: Set up recurring billing plans with customizable parameters
- **Activate subscriptions**: Begin billing cycles with customer payment information
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily halt billing without cancellation
- **Update subscriptions**: Modify pricing, billing details, or subscription parameters
- **Cancel subscriptions**: End recurring billing permanently or at period end

### Customer-Friendly Features

- **Automated recurring payments**: No manual action required for subsequent billing
- **Consistent billing dates**: Predictable billing on the same day of each period
- **Payment retry mechanism**: Automatic retries for failed payments
- **Customer control**: Enable customers to manage their own subscriptions

### Integration Benefits

- **Webhook notifications**: Get real-time updates on subscription status changes
- **Detailed reporting**: Track subscription metrics and performance
- **Simplified compliance**: Handle recurring billing requirements automatically
- **Reduced churn**: Automatic billing helps prevent missed payments

## Testing

### Test Mode Limitations

- **Active subscription limit**: In test mode, you can have only three active subscriptions at any time
- **Automatic cancellation**: All subscriptions are automatically canceled after twelve payments (except when using the 5565 test card)

### Test Mode Intervals

- **Minute and hour intervals**: Only available in test mode for rapid testing of subscription cycles

### Testing Failed Payments

For testing subscription payment failures, use a test card with the following characteristics:

- **Test card ending in 5565**: Use test card that ending in 5565 (see [Test card numbers](https://docs.monei.com/testing/#test-card-numbers))
- **Payment behavior**:
  - The first payment for the subscription will be successful
  - All subsequent payments will fail
  - After the first failed payment, the subscription status changes to `Past due`
  - After three consecutive failed payments, the subscription will be automatically cancelled
