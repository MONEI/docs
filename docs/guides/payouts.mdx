The MONEI Payouts API allows you to send money to individuals via Bizum or Cards.

:::warning
The Payouts API is currently in closed beta. To request access, please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new). Please note that the Payouts API is not available in the test environment.
:::

## Before you begin

To enable MONEI payouts, it is essential to maintain a positive balance in the merchant account at all times. Additionally, a minimum initial top-up of €5,000 to the merchant account balance is required to fully activate the payout functionality.

## Payouts with Bizum

Before you start, you need to make sure that you have Bizum enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods). If you don't have Bizum configured, please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new).

To test your Bizum payout integration:

You can use the [MONEI API endpoint](/apis/rest/bizum/) to verify if the phone number is registered with Bizum before sending the money to the end user.

Bizum payouts do not require client's confirmation. You only need to know their phone number.

### 1. Create a new payment on your server.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "amount": 110,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "orderId": "14379133960355",
    "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
    "transactionType": "PAYOUT",
    "paymentMethod": {
      "bizum": {
        "phoneNumber": "+34500000000"
      }
    }
}'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei, TransactionTypes} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  transactionType: TransactionTypes.PAYOUT,
  paymentMethod: {
    bizum: {
      phoneNumber: '+34500000000'
    }
  }
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'transactionType' => 'PAYOUT',
  'paymentMethod' => [
    'bizum' => [
      'phoneNumber' => '+34500000000'
    ]
  ]
]);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **transactionType** `string` - `PAYOUT`
- **paymentMethod** `object` - Payment method object. It must contain `bizum` object with `phoneNumber` property.

Check all available [request parameters](/apis/rest/payments-create/).

### 2. Handle the response

Example response:

Bizum payouts are executed immediately. If the request is successful, you will receive a `PAID_OUT` status in the response.

```json
{
  "id": "af6029f80f5fc73a8ad2753eea0b1be0",
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "14379133960355",
  "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
  "livemode": true,
  "status": "PAID_OUT",
  "statusCode": "E000",
  "statusMessage": "Transaction approved",
  "createdAt": 1685430038,
  "updatedAt": 1685430039,
  "paymentMethod": {
    "method": "bizum",
    "bizum": {
      "phoneNumber": "+34500000000",
      "integrationType": "REST"
    }
  },
  "nextAction": {
    "type": "COMPLETE",
    "redirectUrl": "https://secure.monei.com/payments/af6029f80f5fc73a8ad2753eea0b1be0/receipt"
  }
}
```

Check the full list of returned [response parameters](/apis/rest/schemas/payment/).

Optionally, you can redirect the client to the `nextAction.redirectUrl` to show the payout status or receipt.

## Payouts with Cards

Payouts are supported by all our integrations. You can use a prebuilt payment page or build a custom checkout to let your client enter their Card details to receive the payout.

Pass the `transactionType` parameter with the value `PAYOUT` to create a payout in the first step of our guides.

- [Use a prebuilt payment page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx)
- [Build a custom checkout](integrations/build-custom-checkout.mdx)

Payouts are only supported for Cards and Bizum payments so, you need to pass the `allowedPaymentMethods` parameter with the values of `card` or `bizum` (in case you have more payment methods enabled)
