The MONEI Payouts API allows you to send money to individuals via Bizum or Cards.

:::warning
The Payouts API is currently in closed beta. If you want to use it, please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new)
:::

## Before you begin

Before you start, you need to make sure that you have Bizum enabled in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods). If you don't have Bizum configured, please contact our [Support Team](https://support.monei.com/hc/requests/new).

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) Account ID and API Key.
- Use the test [phone numbers](testing.md#test-bizum-phone-numbers).
- You can check the status of a test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).


## Payouts with Bizum

Bizum payouts do not require client's confirmation. You only need to know their phone number.

:::caution
Bizum payouts are not fully supported by all the banks yet. **If the client's bank doesn't support Bizum payouts, the request will fail**.

### 1. Create a new payment on your server.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.com/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.com/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "amount": 110,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "orderId": "14379133960355",
    "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
    "transactionType": "PAYOUT",
    "paymentMethod": {
      "bizum": {
        "phoneNumber": "+34500000000"
      }
    }
}'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node">

```js title="server.js"
const {Monei, TransactionTypes} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  transactionType: TransactionTypes.PAYOUT,
  paymentMethod: {
    bizum: {
      phoneNumber: "+34500000000"
    }
  }
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'transactionType' => 'PAYOUT',
  'paymentMethod' => [
    'bizum' => [
      'phoneNumber' => '+34500000000'
    ]
  ]
]);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **transactionType** `string` - `PAYOUT`
- **paymentMethod** `object` - Payment method object. It must contain `bizum` object with `phoneNumber` property.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

### 2. Handle the response

Example response:

Bizum payouts are executed immediately. If the request is successful, you will receive a `PAID_OUT` status in the response.

```json
{
    "id": "af6029f80f5fc73a8ad2753eea0b1be0",
    "amount": 110,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "orderId": "14379133960355",
    "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
    "livemode": true,
    "status": "PAID_OUT",
    "statusCode": "E000",
    "statusMessage": "Transaction approved",
    "createdAt": 1685430038,
    "updatedAt": 1685430039,
    "paymentMethod": {
        "method": "bizum",
        "bizum": {
            "phoneNumber": "+34500000000",
            "integrationType": "REST"
        }
    },
    "nextAction": {
        "type": "COMPLETE",
        "redirectUrl": "https://secure.monei.com/payments/af6029f80f5fc73a8ad2753eea0b1be0/receipt"
    }
}
```

Check the full list of returned [response parameters](/api/#section/Payment-object).

Optionally, you can redirect the client to the `nextAction.redirectUrl` to show the payout status or receipt.

## Payouts with Cards

Payouts are supported by all our integrations. You can use a prebuilt payment page or build a custom checkout to let your client enter their Card details to receive the payout.

Pass the `transactionType` parameter with the value `PAYOUT` to create a payout in the first step of our guides.

- [Use a prebuilt payment page](integrations/use-prebuilt-payment-page.mdx)
- [Build a custom checkout](integrations/build-custom-checkout.mdx)

Payouts are only supported for Cards and Bizum payments so, you need to pass the `allowedPaymentMethods` parameter with the values of `card` or `bizum` (in case you have more payment methods enabled)
