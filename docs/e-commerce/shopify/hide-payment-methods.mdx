title: Hide Payment Methods by Country
description: Learn how to hide payment methods on your Shopify checkout based on customer country location using Checkout Blocks (Shopify Plus) or Puco (standard Shopify).
---

You can hide specific payment methods on your Shopify checkout page based on the customer's country location. This is useful when you have region-specific payment methods like MONEI Bizum (Spain) or MONEI Multibanco (Portugal) that should only be shown to customers in those countries.

## Overview

When you have multiple MONEI payment methods installed, you can use conditional logic to show only the relevant payment methods to customers based on their country. The approach depends on your Shopify plan:

- **Shopify Plus**: Use Checkout Blocks (official Shopify app)
- **Other Plans for Shopify**: Use Puco or ETP Sort Hide Payment Methods (third-party apps)
