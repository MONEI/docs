## Before you begin

To test your integration:

- Use your [test mode](testing.md) API Key. You can find them in [MONEI Dashboard → Settings → API Access](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/api)
- You can check the status of a test payment in your [MONEI Dashboard → Payments](https://dashboard.monei.com/payments) (in test mode).

## Install

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="composer"
  values={[
    {label: 'Using composer (recommended)', value: 'composer'},
    {label: 'From the raw package', value: 'archive'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="composer">

You can install MONEI Adobe Commerce Extension using composer by adding it to your composer file using following command:

```shell
composer require monei/module-monei-payment
```

Enable module

```shell
php magento/bin/magento module:enable Monei_MoneiPayment
```

Finally, run setup upgrade to enable new modules:

```shell
php magento/bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="archive">

You can install MONEI Adobe Commerce Extension from the raw package by downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/MONEI/MONEI-AdobeCommerce-Magento2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Create a directory called `app/code/Monei/MoneiPayment`, inside your magento2 project, and you unzip the downloaded archive there.

Go to Adobe Commerce (Magento 2) root directory and run:

```shell
  php bin/magento module:enable Monei_MoneiPayment
  php bin/magento setup:upgrade
  php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
  php bin/magento cache:clean
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure

To configure the extension you have to go to **Stores → Configuration→ Payment Methods (under Sales section) →
MONEI**

## Before you go live

- Make sure that you are using [live (production) mode](testing.md) API Key.
- Make sure that you have at least one active [payment method](https://dashboard.monei.com/settings/payment-methods)
