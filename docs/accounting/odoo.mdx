3. The system will:

### How Syncing Works

1. **Initial Sync**
   - After configuring your API key, use the Sync button to import payments
   - Select a date range to import payments from that period
   - The module will import all MONEI payments within the selected dates

2. **Syncing Process**
   - Go to MONEI > Payments
   - Click the "Sync Payments" button
   - Select start and end dates for the sync
   - The module will:
     - Import new payments from the selected period
     - Update existing payment information
     - Show a summary of changes when complete

3. **Order Matching**
   - Payments are automatically linked to sale orders using the order reference
   - Each payment's order reference is matched to a sale order number
   - View linked payments directly from the sale order form

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify your API credentials are correct
2. Check your Odoo system logs
3. Ensure your Odoo instance can connect to MONEI's API
4. Try re-syncing your payments manually
5. Contact [MONEI support](https://support.monei.com) if issues persist

Common issues:

- **Sync button not working**: Verify your API credentials and internet connection
- **Payments not linking to orders**: Ensure order references match between systems

:::tip
Keep your app updated to the latest version to ensure you have all the latest features and security updates.
