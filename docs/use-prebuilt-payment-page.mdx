## Integration

### 1. Create a new payment on your server.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="curl"
  groupId="code"
  values={[
    {label: 'cURL', value: 'curl'},
    {label: 'Node.js', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'PHP', value: 'php'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">


```shell script title="POST https://api.monei.net/v1/payments"
curl --request POST 'https://api.monei.net/v1/payments' \
--header 'Authorization: pk_test_3c140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540e00' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "amount": 110,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "orderId": "14379133960355",
    "description": "Test Shop - #14379133960355",
    "customer": {
       "email": "john.doe@microapps.com"
    },
    "callbackUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/callback",
    "completeUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/complete",
    "cancelUrl": "https://example.com/checkout/cancel"
}'
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="node">


```js title="server.js"
const {Monei} = require('@monei-js/node-sdk');
const monei = new Monei('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
monei.payments.create({
  amount: 110,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '14379133960355',
  description: 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  customer: {
    email: 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  },
  callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/callback',
  completeUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/complete',
  cancelUrl: 'https://example.com/checkout/cancel'
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">


```php title="server.php"
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('pk_test_36cf3e8a15eff3f5be983562ea6b13ec');
$monei->payments->create([
  'amount' => 110,
  'currency' => 'EUR',
  'orderId' => '14379133960355',
  'description' => 'Test Shop - #14379133960355',
  'customer' => [
    'email' => 'john.doe@microapps.com'
  ],
  'callbackUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/callback',
  'completeUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/complete',
  'cancelUrl' => 'https://example.com/checkout/cancel'
]);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


The following parameters are required:

- **amount** `positive integer` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge 1.00 USD)
- **currency** `string` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency.
- **orderId** `string` - An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system.
- **completeUrl** `string` - The URL the customer will be directed to after transaction completed (successful or failed).
- **callbackUrl** `string` - The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously.
- **cancelUrl** `string` - The URL the customer will be directed to if they decide to cancel payment and return to your website.

Check all available [request parameters](/api/#operation/payments_create).

### 2. Redirect customer to the `redirectUrl` from the response

In the response from the first request you'll get the following response:

```json
{
  "id": "af6029f80f5fc73a8ad2753eea0b1be0",
  "amount": 110,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "orderId": "84370745531439",
  "description": "Test Shop - #84370745531439",
  "accountId": "aa9333ba-82de-400c-9ae7-087b9f8d2242",
  "providerReferenceId": null,
  "authorizationCode": null,
  "livemode": false,
  "status": "PENDING",
  "statusCode": null,
  "statusMessage": null,
  "customer": {
    "email": "john.doe@microapps.com",
    "name": null,
    "phone": null
  },
  "paymentMethod": null,
  "shop": null,
  "billingDetails": null,
  "shippingDetails": null,
  "refundedAmount": null,
  "lastRefundAmount": null,
  "lastRefundReason": null,
  "sessionDetails": null,
  "nextAction": {
    "type": "CONFIRM",
    "mustRedirect": false,
    "redirectUrl": "https://secure.monei.net/payments/af6029f80f5fc73a8ad2753eea0b1be0"
  },
  "createdAt": 1594215339,
  "updatedAt": null
}
```

Redirect the customer to the `nextAction.redirectUrl` to show him a MONEI Hosted payment page.

:::note
As an alternative process you can confirm the payment using monei.js on the client-side. In this case your customer does not need to leave your website. Check our [payment modal guide](use-payment-modal.mdx).
:::

### 3. Customer completes payment

Customer enters credit card information (or other payment information depending on the selected payment method) and goes through 3D secure verification process (is redirected to the page provided by the bank issued the card for confirmation of the transaction) if required.

### 4. Customer is redirected back to your server.

- if customer clicks **"Back to {{shop.name}}"** link (you can provide `shop.name` parameter when you create a charge or in [branding settings](https://dashboard.monei.net/settings/branding)), he is redirected to `cancelUrl`. (Usually this url is the checkout page on your website, where the user had started a checkout process)
- in any other case a customer is redirected to the `completeUrl` with **payment_id** query parameter. Use [get payment](/api/#operation/payments_get) endpoint to get the payment status.

### 5. An asynchronous request is sent to your server.

MONEI will notify you about a payment status by sending an HTTP POST request to the `callbackUrl`. The request body will contain full [payment object](/api/#section/Payment-object) in JSON format.

This ensures that you get the payment status even when customer closed the browser window or lost internet connection.

The request also contains a `MONEI-Signature` header. [Verify this signature](verify-signature.mdx) to confirm that received request is sent from MONEI.

To acknowledge receipt of the request, your endpoint must return a `200` HTTP status code to MONEI. All other response codes, including `3xx` codes, indicate to MONEI that you did not receive the event.

If MONEI does not receive a `200` HTTP status code, the notification attempt is repeated. After multiple failures to send the notification over multiple days, MONEI marks the request as failed and stops trying to send it to your endpoint.
